# Django Signals: Synchronous or Asynchronous?

## Question 1

Are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously by default? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance.

## Answer

By default, Django signals are executed **synchronously**. This means that when a signal is triggered, the associated handlers are executed immediately, and the main execution flow is blocked until the handlers complete their task. Django does not provide asynchronous signal handling out of the box, so all signals are processed within the same thread as the signal sender.

### Code Example

To demonstrate this, hereâ€™s a basic example using the `post_save` signal:

1. **Define a Django model** in `myapp/models.py`:

    ```python
    from django.db import models

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
    ```

2. **Create a signal handler** in `myapp/signals.py` that simulates a delay with `time.sleep()`:

    ```python
    from django.db.models.signals import post_save
    from django.dispatch import receiver
    from .models import MyModel
    import time

    @receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
    def my_model_post_save(sender, instance, **kwargs):
        print("Signal handler started")
        time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running task
        print("Signal handler finished")
    ```

3. **Connect the signal** in `myapp/apps.py` to ensure it is registered:

    ```python
    from django.apps import AppConfig

    class MyappConfig(AppConfig):
        name = 'myapp'

        def ready(self):
            import myapp.signals
    ```

    Make sure to set this config in `myapp/__init__.py`:

    ```python
    default_app_config = 'myapp.apps.MyappConfig'
    ```

4. **Trigger the signal** by creating a new instance of `MyModel` in a view (`myapp/views.py`):

    ```python
    from django.shortcuts import render
    from .models import MyModel

    def create_instance(request):
        MyModel.objects.create(name="Test Signal")
        return render(request, 'myapp/index.html')
    ```

5. **Observe the output** after running the application and accessing the view:

    ```
    Signal handler started
    (5-second delay)
    Signal handler finished
    ```

This output confirms that the signal handler is executed synchronously, as the 5-second delay caused by `time.sleep()` blocks the main thread until the handler finishes.

### Conclusion

Django signals are executed synchronously by default, and the signal handlers run in the same thread as the signal sender, blocking the execution until they complete.
